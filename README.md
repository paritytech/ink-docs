## Development Notes

If you need to run ReCaptcha on your localhost you will need to add `dev.use.ink` to your `/etc/hosts`.

### Linux
```sh
sudo bash -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 dev.use.ink" >> /etc/hosts'
```

### OSX
```sh
sudo bash -c 'echo "::1 dev.use.ink" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then visit [http://dev.use.ink:8080/](http://dev.use.ink:8080/) (Don't forget the port number)
