# Contracts on Rococo

[Rococo](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-pdk#rococo-testnet) is a testnet for
Polkadot and Kusama parachains.
We have a live testnet named Contracts as a parachain online there.

## What is the Contracts parachain?

It's a [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) parachain for smart
contracts. We configured it to use Substrate's smart contracts module – the
[`contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts)
pallet – in a default configuration.

The code for this parachain can be found [in the `cumulus` repository](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachains/runtimes/contracts/contracts-rococo).
Our parachain uses the Rococo relay chain's native token (`ROC`) instead of having its own token.
Due to this you'll need `ROC` in order to deploy contracts on our testnet.

## How can I use it?
### (1) Create an Account

As a first step, you should create an account. This can be done via command-line
tools (e.g. `subxt`) or via a wallet (e.g. with the `polkadot-js` browser extension).
See [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-account-generation) for a detailed guide.

### (2) Get Testnet Tokens

As a second step, you have to get `ROC` testnet tokens through the [Rococo Faucet](./faucet.md).

Alternatively, you can use the [Element chat room](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-DOT#getting-tokens-on-the-rococo-testnet).
You must send a message like this (Note the `:1002` after the wallet address):

```
!drip YOUR_SS_58_ADDRESS:1002
```

The number `1002` is the parachain ID of Contracts on Rococo, by supplying it you instruct the
faucet to teleport `ROC` tokens directly to your account on the parachain.
If you have some tokens on the Rococo relay chain, you can teleport them to the Contracts parachain on your own. Read more on teleporting assets [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-teleport).

If everything worked out, the teleported `ROC` tokens will show up in your account.
In case you are using the `polkadot-js` frontend, you can see them under
[the "Accounts" tab for Contracts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-contracts-rpc.polkadot.io#/accounts).

### (3) Deploy Your Contract

Once you have `ROC` on Contracts you can deploy a contract _nearly_ as you would with
a local developer node.
The only difference is that you can't use pre-endowed accounts like `Alice` or `Bob`,
you have to use the one you generated instead.

You can also deploy your contract from the command-line via `cargo-contract`.
Make sure you are in the folder of your contract and that it has been
built recently. Then execute:

```bash
cargo contract upload --suri "your twelve or twenty-four words"
cargo contract instantiate --suri … --constructor new --args true
```

`new` in this case would be a constructor method exposed by the contract,
`--args` would be any arguments the constructor expects.

See [the `cargo-contract` docs](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/blob/master/crates/extrinsics/README.md#commands)
for a more detailed documentation.
