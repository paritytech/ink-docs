Hey there reader üëã!

This is meant to be a high-level overview of the changes that have taken place as part of
Parity's Web Assembly (Wasm) smart contract efforts. These efforts include the [`ink!`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink)
programming language, the [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts) execution environment, the [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract)
development tool, and the [Contracts parachain](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachains/runtimes/contracts/contracts-rococo). For anything UI related go check out the
[`contracts-ui` repository](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts-ui).

If these updates are too high-level for you you can always check out the release notes for
the various projects:
- [`ink!`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/contracts/CHANGELOG.md)
- [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

If you're new here and aren't sure where to get started with ink! check out our
[guided tutorial for beginners](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/smart-contracts/).
