Check out link! â€“ a URL shortener DApp. It consists of a frontend and an ink! contract.
You can view an online demo of the Dapp here: https://tiny.ink.

To create new short links you need `ROC` tokens from our testnet.
See [here](/testnet) for how to get those.

The repository is located here: [https://github.com/paritytech/link](https://github.com/paritytech/link).
