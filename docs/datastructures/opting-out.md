title: Opt out of Storage
slug: /datastructures/opting-out
---

If you are in need of storing some temporary information across method and message
boundaries ink! will have your back with the `ink_storage::Memory` abstraction. It allows
you to simply opt-out of using the storage for the wrapped entity at all and thus is very
similar to Solidity's very own `memory` annotation.

An example below:

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct OptedOut {
    a: i32,
    b: ink_storage::Memory<i32>,
}
```

The the above example `a` is a normal storage entry, however, `b` on the other
hand side will never load from or store to contract storage and will always be reset to
the default value of its `i32` type for every contract call. It can be accessed from all
ink! messages or methods via `self.b`, but will never manipulate the contract storage and
thus acts wonderfully as some shared local information.
