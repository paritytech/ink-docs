## Overview

A frontend for ink! dApps is typically powered by `polkadot-js/api` packages and developed with the help of frameworks like React or Next.js. For further convenience, the ink! team has built the [`useink`](#useink) library abstracting away complexity of the underlying core libraries. As a great starting point for developing full-stack dApps with smart contracts and a pre-connected frontend, you can try the [ink!athon](/getting-started/inkathon) boilerplate built by the community.
