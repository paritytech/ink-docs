# Types

## `RustResult<T, E>`

This type models a `Result<T, E>` message response in ink! contracts starting in v4.0.0.
Prior to ink! v4.0.0 any contract that returned a `Result<T, E>` in Rust would return `T`
or undefined. See [pickResultOk](/frontend/utils/pick#pickresultok) and
[pickResultErr](/frontend/utils/pick#pickresultErr), which can be used with contracts that
return a `Result<T, E>`.

`type RustResult<T, E> = { Ok?: T; Err?: E };`
