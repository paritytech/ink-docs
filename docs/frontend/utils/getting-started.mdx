# Getting Started with useink/utils 

`useink/utils` is an extension of `useink` that provides general utility functions for
formatting balances, working with Big Numbers and decimals, converting data types (e.g.
hex to string), and more. `useink/utils` currently exports
[@polkadot/utils](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common/tree/master/packages/util/src),
but we will be adding new utility functions in the future.

## Installation

You must first [install useink](/frontend/getting-started#installation).
Then you can import utils with `import * as U from 'useink/utils'`.

See [@polkadot/utils](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common/tree/master/packages/util/src)
for a list of all utility functions.

## Configure tsconfig.json

You must set `moduleResolution` to `nodenext` or `bundler` inside of your `tsconfig.json`.
This feature allows your application to discover the `useink/utils` import paths defined
in the **useink** `package.json`. 

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "nodenext", // or `bundler`
  }
}
```
