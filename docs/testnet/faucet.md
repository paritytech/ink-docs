<Faucet/>

We are operating a faucet for our [Contracts Testnet on Rococo](./overview.md).
By requesting funds from the form above you will receive `ROC`
tokens to your account on this parachain.

Note that the funds won't be available on the relaychain, the faucet teleports
them  directly to our parachain ([see here for more details](./overview.md)).
The polkadot-js UI will display them under [the "Accounts" tab for the Contracts parachain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-contracts-rpc.polkadot.io#/accounts):
