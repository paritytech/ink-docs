## Workshops & Talks ðŸŽ¤

[Michi](https://github.com/cmichi) gave a few talks this month!
- A workshop for the ChainLink spring hackathon
    - [YouTube link: Parity's ink! 101 | Write Smart Contracts for Substrate-Based Chains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J6BsbOaedw).
- An introduction to ink! for Supercolony's [Wasm Conference](https://wasm-conference.com/)
    - We'll update this with a link to the recording once it's uploaded!

## `awesome-ink` Repository ðŸ¤©

Following popular demand we've created
[https://github.com/paritytech/awesome-ink](https://github.com/paritytech/awesome-ink) â€’
a curated list of awesome projects related to ink!.

## Playground ðŸ•¹

The ink! playground has been published at [https://ink-playground.substrate.io](https://ink-playground.substrate.io)!

It's handy for a couple of things. For example:

* You want to experiment with developing a contract without having to set up Rust locally.
* You run into an error and want to share a permalink to a code example, so that somebody
can help you find the issue. This can be very helpful in case you post a question e.g. on our
[StackExchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ink?tab=Votes) site.

## Releases ðŸ†•

For ink! we released [v3.1.0](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases/tag/v3.1.0),
and [v3.2.0](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases/tag/v3.2.0).

For for [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/) we released
[v1.4.0](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/releases/tag/v1.4.0).

The release notes contain more details.

### Polkadot v0.9.22
The [Polkadot v0.9.22](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.22)
release brought with it some exciting changes for the Contracts pallet. The release
includes [a fix](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11372) for a possible
PoV attack vector.

The tl;dr here is that `pallet-contracts` can be safely added to your production runtimes
(although it would _probably_ have been fine before too, on Kusama anyways ðŸ˜‰).

We have included this fix as part of the [v0.16.0](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/releases/tag/v0.16.0)
release of the
[`substrate-contracts-node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node).

## The URL to this portal changed

It's now available at [https://ink.substrate.io](https://ink.substrate.io).

## Canvas Testnet âžœ Contracts Testnet

We've renamed our "Canvas" testnet to "Contracts" testnet.
More information about the background for this can be found in
[last months digest](/monthly-update/2022/04#canvas-update).

## Berlin Work Session ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
Part of the team met up with our valued contributor [@xgreenx](https://github.com/xgreenx)
in Berlin to talk about ink!.

In particular, the session focused on an upcoming refactoring of the ink! storage system
(PR [#1217](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1217)) which Green is actively
working on.
