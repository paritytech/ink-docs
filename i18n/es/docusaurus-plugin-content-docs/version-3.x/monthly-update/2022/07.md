## ðŸŒŒ Roloi migrates from CosmWasm to ink!

We're very happy about this:
The Roloi team has migrated their smart contracts from CosmWasm to ink!.

They wrote a blog post with a number of flattering words on their migration
process:

## ðŸ“º Wasm Conference 2022 Recordings

In May, the [SuperColony team](https://supercolony.net/) organized
a conference on WebAssembly smart contracts in Polkadot.

[Alex](https://github.com/athei) and [Michi](https://github.com/cmichi) 
took part there and the recordings have been uploaded now:

* Talk: [What is Parity's "ink!"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtNKW2oeXs).
* Panel: [Will WASM be able to substitute EVM?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ_fJZ5yosg).

There were also a number of other interesting talks from Wasm Smart Contract stakeholders.
For example, [The Bright Future of WebAssembly Smart Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO5EEjYqb80).
